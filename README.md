# Burger App

[Live](https://lit-escarpment-97125.herokuapp.com/index)


A full stack application that tracks burger names and whether they have been eaten or not. Users can enter the name of a new burger to add it to the page. They can also click the consume button next to any burger to move it to the 'consumed' list.
